<request>$ARGUMENTS</request>

## Review Instructions

1. First, analyze all changes by running:
   - `git status` to see modified files
   - `git diff` to see unstaged changes
   - `git diff --staged` to see staged changes
   - Review any new untracked files

2. Perform a thorough review focusing on both technical excellence and long-term maintainability.

## Evaluation Checklists

### üîç Code Quality & Design
- [ ] **Single Concept**: Each function/class has one clear purpose
- [ ] **SOLID Principles**: Do not fret overmuch about solid principles
- [ ] **Colocation of Related Code**: Related code is grouped together
- [ ] **Naming**: Variables, functions, and classes have clear, descriptive names
- [ ] **Code Organization**: Logical file structure and module organization
- [ ] **Complexity**: Functions are not overly complex (cyclomatic complexity < 10)
- [ ] **Dead Code**: No commented-out code or unused imports/variables
- [ ] **Exception Neutrality**: Code does not require explicit cleaup for exceptions, and uses try/finally as the primary approach before try/catch
- [ ] **Error Context**: attach as much debugging context to errors as possible, including parameter and variable values

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Safety
- [ ] **Input Validation**: All user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- [ ] **Authentication/Authorization**: Proper access controls in place
- [ ] **Sensitive Data**: No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or passwords
- [ ] **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries used, no string concatenation
- [ ] **XSS Prevention**: Output properly escaped for context
- [ ] **Dependencies**: No known vulnerable dependencies introduced
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Errors don't expose sensitive information

### ‚ö° Performance & Scalability
- [ ] **Algorithm Efficiency**: Optimal algorithms used (consider time/space complexity)
- [ ] **Database Queries**: No N+1 queries, proper indexing considered
- [ ] **Caching**: Appropriate caching strategies where beneficial
- [ ] **Memory Management**: No memory leaks, proper resource cleanup
- [ ] **Async Operations**: Proper use of async/await, no blocking operations
- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Large datasets handled efficiently

### üß™ Testing & Reliability
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: New code has appropriate assert coverage
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Tests cover boundary conditions and error scenarios
- [ ] **Test Quality**: Tests are meaningful, not just for coverage metrics
- [ ] **Error Handling**: All error paths properly handled
- [ ] **Logging**: Appropriate logging for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] **Rollback Safety**: Changes can be safely rolled back if needed

### üìö Documentation & Maintainability
- [ ] **Code Comments**: Complex logic is well-commented
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Public APIs have clear documentation
- [ ] **README Updates**: Documentation updated if functionality changed
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Proper typing (if applicable to language)
- [ ] **Configuration**: Environment-specific configs properly managed
- [ ] **Migration Path**: Breaking changes have clear migration instructions
- [ ] **Requirements**: Current state of the system are documented in project level requirements documentation.

### üîÑ Best Practices & Standards
- [ ] **Code Style**: Follows project's coding standards and conventions
- [ ] **Git Hygiene**: Atomic commits with clear messages
- [ ] **Backwards Compatibility**: Changes don't break existing functionality
- [ ] **Feature Flags**: Large changes can be toggled if needed
- [ ] **Internationalization**: UI strings are properly externalized
- [ ] **Accessibility**: UI changes follow accessibility guidelines

## Additional Context Questions
Before finalizing your review, consider:
1. Does this change align with the project's architecture?
2. Will this scale with expected growth?
3. Are there any implicit assumptions that should be documented?
4. What could go wrong in production?
5. How would you debug issues with this code?
