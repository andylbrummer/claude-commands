```

## Quick Start: Subagent Execution

### For Task Master (Orchestrator):
1. ‚úÖ Context package created from [subtasks-plan.md](subtasks-plan.md)
2. ‚úÖ Task files generated with context references
3. ‚úÖ Worktrees set up in `~/work/worktrees/<feature>/`
4. Start subagent coordination process below

### For Individual Subagents:
1. ‚úÖ Receive task file with complete context package
2. ‚úÖ Validate context sources and patterns
3. Follow execution process for your task type
4. ‚Üí Report completion for integration review

---

## Subagent Coordination Process

### Task Master Responsibilities

#### 1. Critical Conflict Prevention (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)

##### File Contention Monitoring
```bash
# CRITICAL: Monitor file editing conflicts in real-time
monitor_file_contention() {
    echo "=== File Contention Monitor ==="
    
    # Track which tasks are editing which files
    for task_dir in ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/*/; do
        task_name=$(basename "$task_dir")
        echo "Task: $task_name"
        
        # Check git status for modified files
        if [[ -d "$task_dir/.git" ]]; then
            git -C "$task_dir" status --porcelain | while read status file; do
                echo "  $status $file"
                
                # Check if file is being edited by other tasks
                grep -r "$file" ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/*/task.md 2>/dev/null | \
                    grep -v "$task_dir" && echo "    ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFLICT: File also targeted by other tasks"
            done
        fi
        echo ""
    done
}

# Run every 5 minutes during active development
watch -n 300 monitor_file_contention
```

##### Merge Conflict Prevention Protocol
```markdown
## MANDATORY: Conflict Prevention Rules

### Rule 1: Shared File Coordination
**Before any task starts editing shared files:**
1. **Lock Shared Files**: Create file edit coordination
2. **Version Interfaces**: Create interface extension pattern
3. **Namespace Changes**: Use separate namespaces/sections
4. **Sequential Editing**: High-contention files edited sequentially

### Rule 2: Interface File Management
**For type definition and interface files:**
```bash
# Create interface versioning system
create_interface_version() {
    local base_file="$1"
    local task_id="$2"
    
    # Create task-specific interface extension
    cp "$base_file" "${base_file%.ts}.${task_id}.ts"
    echo "// Extends base interface for task: $task_id" >> "${base_file%.ts}.${task_id}.ts"
    
    # Update task to use extended interface
    echo "Using interface extension: ${base_file%.ts}.${task_id}.ts"
}
```

### Rule 3: Configuration File Coordination
**For configuration and utility files:**
- **Namespace Separation**: Each task gets own config section
- **Merge Strategy**: Use structured merge with conflict markers
- **Validation**: Automated validation of merged configs
```

##### Resource Contention Prevention
```bash
# Prevent database/service contention
allocate_test_resources() {
    local task_id="$1"
    local base_port=3000
    
    # Calculate unique port for each task
    task_number=$(echo "$task_id" | grep -o '[0-9]*' | head -1)
    task_port=$((base_port + task_number * 10))
    
    echo "Task $task_id allocated ports: $task_port-$((task_port + 9))"
    
    # Create task-specific test database
    echo "CREATE DATABASE test_${task_id};" | psql postgres
    
    # Set task-specific environment
    cat > "~/work/worktrees/<feature>/$task_id/.env.task" << EOF
PORT=$task_port
DB_NAME=test_${task_id}
REDIS_PORT=$((task_port + 1))
TEST_PORT=$((task_port + 2))
EOF
}
```

#### 2. Context Package Distribution
```bash
# Ensure all worktrees have context access
for task_dir in ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/*/; do
    ln -sf $(pwd)/requests/<feature>/context $task_dir/context
    echo "Context linked for: $task_dir"
done

# Validate context accessibility
for task_dir in ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/*/; do
    if [[ -f "$task_dir/context/codebase-analysis.md" ]]; then
        echo "‚úì Context accessible: $task_dir"
    else
        echo "‚úó Context missing: $task_dir"
    fi
done
```

#### 2. Subagent Task Assignment
```markdown
## Task Assignment Process
1. **High-Risk Tasks First**: Start with HIGH risk tasks to discover blockers early
2. **Parallel Safe Tasks**: Launch multiple MEDIUM/LOW risk tasks in parallel
3. **Dependency Ordering**: Ensure prerequisite tasks complete before dependent tasks
4. **Context Validation**: Each subagent validates context before starting

## Subagent Spawn Commands
```bash
# Research tasks (can run in parallel)
claude-code --worktree ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/01-research-api/ "Execute research task with context from ./context/"

# Architecture tasks (depends on research)
claude-code --worktree ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/02-arch-design/ "Execute architecture task with context from ./context/"

# Development tasks (parallel after architecture)
claude-code --worktree ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/03-dev-backend/ "Execute development task with context from ./context/" &
claude-code --worktree ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/03-dev-frontend/ "Execute development task with context from ./context/" &
claude-code --worktree ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/03-dev-integration/ "Execute development task with context from ./context/" &

# Wait for development completion before review
wait
```

#### 3. Progress Monitoring
```markdown
## Task Status Tracking
| Task ID | Persona | Status | Worktree | Context Applied | Issues |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| 01-research-api | Research Analyst | ‚úÖ Complete | ~/work/worktrees/feature/01/ | ‚úÖ | None |
| 02-arch-design | System Architect | üîÑ In Progress | ~/work/worktrees/feature/02/ | ‚úÖ | None |
| 03-dev-backend | Software Engineer | ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked | ~/work/worktrees/feature/03/ | ‚ùå Missing context | Context link broken |
| 03-dev-frontend | Software Engineer | ‚è≥ Pending | ~/work/worktrees/feature/04/ | - | Waiting for arch |
```

## Individual Subagent Execution

### Context Validation & Execution Log Setup (Required First Step)
```bash
# Every subagent must validate context access
echo "Validating context package..."
if [[ ! -d "./context" ]]; then
    echo "‚ùå FATAL: Context package not accessible"
    echo "Required: ./context/ directory with master analysis"
    exit 1
fi

# Validate required context files
required_files=("codebase-analysis.md" "external-sources.md" "implementation-patterns.md")
for file in "${required_files[@]}"; do
    if [[ ! -f "./context/$file" ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå FATAL: Missing required context: $file"
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "‚úÖ Context file present: $file"
done

echo "‚úÖ Context validation complete"

# Initialize execution log for this worktree
task_name=$(basename $(pwd))
cat > execution-log.md << 'EOF'
# Execution Log: [Task Name]
**Started**: $(date)
**Worktree**: $(pwd)
**Task ID**: TASK_ID_PLACEHOLDER
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS

## File Changes Tracking
### Estimated vs Actual Files
**Estimated Files** (from task file):
[Copy from task.md file scope section]

**Actual Files** (updated during execution):
[Update as files are modified]

### Unexpected Files
[Track any files not in original estimate]

## Web Searches Performed
[Track all web searches for research and troubleshooting]

## Build Failures & Fixes
[Track all build failures and their resolutions]

## Multi-Fix Files
[Track files that required 2+ separate fixes]

## Deferred Items
[Track any items pushed to future tasks]

## New Tasks Added
[Track any new tasks discovered during execution]

## Context Application Log
[Track how context package was used during implementation]

## Integration Coordination
[Track any coordination with other parallel tasks]

## Completion Status
- [ ] All estimated files handled
- [ ] All build failures resolved
- [ ] All multi-fix files completed
- [ ] All deferred items documented
- [ ] Context properly applied
- [ ] Integration points verified
- [ ] Log reviewed and formatted
EOF

# Replace placeholder with actual task name
sed -i "s/TASK_ID_PLACEHOLDER/$task_name/" execution-log.md
sed -i "s/\\[Task Name\\]/$task_name/" execution-log.md

echo "‚úÖ Execution log initialized"
```

### Context Application Process

#### 1. Read and Apply Context
```markdown
## Context Application Checklist
- [ ] **Read codebase-analysis.md**: Understand similar patterns and file dependencies
- [ ] **Read external-sources.md**: Review relevant documentation and standards
- [ ] **Read implementation-patterns.md**: Identify specific patterns to follow
- [ ] **Validate file scope**: Ensure all files in task scope exist and are accessible
```

#### 2. Implementation with Context Guidance & Logging
```markdown
## Context-Informed Implementation
### Before Writing Code:
1. **Find Similar Implementation**: Look for pattern from codebase-analysis.md
2. **Review External Standards**: Apply guidelines from external-sources.md  
3. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use patterns from implementation-patterns.md
4. **Validate Integration Points**: Ensure compatibility with other tasks

### During Implementation:
- **Reference Context**: Continuously refer to context package for guidance
- **Document Deviations**: Note any deviations from suggested patterns
- **Validate Frequently**: Run validation commands from task file
- **Update Context**: Document any new patterns discovered
- **Log Everything**: Use execution logging commands throughout

### Execution Logging Commands for Subagents
```bash
# Log web searches
log_web_search() {
    local search_terms="$1"
    local purpose="$2"
    local findings="$3"
    
    echo "
- **$(date)**: Searched for \"$search_terms\"
  - **Purpose**: $purpose
  - **Key findings**: $findings
  - **Applied**: [How it influenced implementation]" >> execution-log.md
}

# Log build failures
log_build_failure() {
    local error_message="$1"
    local command="$2"
    local fix="$3"
    
    echo "
- **$(date)**: Build failed with: $error_message
  - **Command**: \`$command\`
  - **Root cause**: [Why it failed]
  - **Fix applied**: $fix
  - **Resolution time**: [how long it took]" >> execution-log.md
}

# Track file changes
log_file_change() {
    local file_path="$1"
    local action="$2"
    
    # Update actual files section
    if grep -q "Actual Files" execution-log.md; then
        echo "- $file_path - [$action] ‚úÖ $(date)" >> execution-log.md
    fi
}

# Log multi-fix files
log_multi_fix() {
    local file_path="$1"
    local fix_description="$2"
    
    echo "
- **$file_path**: Additional fix required
  - **Fix**: $fix_description
  - **Reason**: [Why additional fix was needed]" >> execution-log.md
}

# Log deferred items
log_deferred_item() {
    local item="$1"
    local reason="$2"
    
    echo "
- **$(date)**: $item
  - **Reason**: $reason
  - **Future task**: [When/how it should be addressed]
  - **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]" >> execution-log.md
}

# Log new tasks
log_new_task() {
    local task="$1"
    local context="$2"
    
    echo "
- **$(date)**: $task
  - **Discovery context**: $context
  - **Estimated effort**: [Time/complexity]
  - **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]" >> execution-log.md
}

# Log context application
log_context_usage() {
    local context_file="$1"
    local pattern_used="$2"
    
    echo "
- **$(date)**: Applied pattern from $context_file
  - **Pattern**: $pattern_used
  - **Implementation**: [How it was applied]" >> execution-log.md
}
```
```

### Task-Type Specific Execution

#### Research Tasks
```markdown
## Research Task Execution Pattern
1. **Context Review**: Read existing research in codebase-analysis.md
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify what additional research is needed
3. **External Investigation**: Use external-sources.md as starting point
4. **Pattern Documentation**: Document findings for other tasks
5. **Context Updates**: Add new findings to context package

## Research Output Format:
- Update relevant context files with new findings
- Create research summary with actionable recommendations
- Document any patterns for development tasks to follow
```

#### Development Tasks  
```markdown
## Development Task Execution Pattern
1. **Pattern Selection**: Choose implementation pattern from context
2. **Similar Code Review**: Study similar implementation from codebase
3. **Standards Application**: Apply external standards from context
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first, following project patterns
5. **Context Validation**: Verify implementation matches context guidance

## Development Validation:
```bash
# Validate pattern application
grep -q "expected_pattern" modified_file.ts && echo "‚úÖ Pattern applied"

# Validate external standards compliance  
npm run lint modified_file.ts && echo "‚úÖ Standards compliant"

# Validate integration points
npm test -- --grep "integration" && echo "‚úÖ Integration verified"

# Validate context consistency
diff <(grep "key_pattern" context/implementation-patterns.md) <(grep "key_pattern" modified_file.ts) && echo "‚úÖ Context consistent"
```

#### Integration Tasks
```markdown
## Integration Task Execution Pattern  
1. **Cross-Task Analysis**: Review all completed development tasks
2. **Context Consistency**: Ensure all tasks followed same patterns
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify components work together
4. **Performance Validation**: Check integration meets context requirements
5. **Documentation Updates**: Update context with integration insights
```

### Error Handling & Context Issues

#### Context Problems & Critical Subagent Gotchas
```markdown
## Context Issue Resolution
### Missing Context Files:
1. **Contact Task Master**: Request context package regeneration
2. **Emergency Context**: Create minimal context from task file information
3. **Pattern Discovery**: Search codebase for similar implementations
4. **Documentation**: Note missing context for future improvement

### Outdated Context:
1. **Validation Check**: Verify external URLs still work
2. **Pattern Verification**: Confirm similar implementations still exist
3. **Update Request**: Request context package refresh from Task Master
4. **Local Updates**: Update context files with current information

### Context Conflicts:
1. **Pattern Conflicts**: When context suggests conflicting patterns
2. **Standard Conflicts**: When external standards conflict with codebase
3. **Escalation**: Report conflicts to Task Master for resolution
4. **Documentation**: Document resolution for future tasks

## CRITICAL Subagent Coordination Gotchas

### File Edit Coordination Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è **GOTCHA**: Multiple tasks editing same interface file
**Problem**: Race condition where Task A defines interface, Task B extends it simultaneously
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Check if file is being edited before starting
check_file_lock() {
    local file="$1"
    if [[ -f "$file.lock" ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå File locked by: $(cat $file.lock)"
        echo "Wait for completion or coordinate with task owner"
        return 1
    fi
    echo "$TASK_ID" > "$file.lock"
    return 0
}

# Always lock before editing shared files
check_file_lock "src/types/api.ts" || exit 1
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **GOTCHA**: Configuration file merge conflicts
**Problem**: Multiple tasks adding different config sections to same file
**Solution**: Use structured merge with validation
```bash
# Use structured config merging
merge_config_section() {
    local config_file="$1"
    local section_name="$2"
    local section_content="$3"
    
    # Add section marker for safe merging
    echo "# CONFIG_SECTION: $section_name - START" >> "$config_file"
    echo "$section_content" >> "$config_file"
    echo "# CONFIG_SECTION: $section_name - END" >> "$config_file"
}
```

### Context Synchronization Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è **GOTCHA**: Context becoming stale during long-running parallel development
**Problem**: External dependencies change, new patterns discovered, context package outdated
**Solution**: Context staleness detection
```bash
# Check context freshness
check_context_staleness() {
    local context_age=$(find ./context -name "*.md" -mtime +1 | wc -l)
    if [[ $context_age -gt 0 ]]; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Context may be stale (>24h old)"
        echo "Consider requesting context refresh from Task Master"
    fi
}
```

### Integration Timing Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è **GOTCHA**: Premature integration attempts
**Problem**: Task A completes, Task B at 50%, integration attempted too early
**Solution**: Integration readiness protocol
```bash
# Check integration readiness
check_integration_readiness() {
    echo "Checking integration readiness across all tasks..."
    local ready_count=0
    local total_count=0
    
    for task_dir in ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/*/; do
        total_count=$((total_count + 1))
        if [[ -f "$task_dir/TASK_COMPLETE" ]]; then
            ready_count=$((ready_count + 1))
            echo "‚úÖ $(basename $task_dir): Ready"
        else
            echo "‚è≥ $(basename $task_dir): In progress"
        fi
    done
    
    if [[ $ready_count -eq $total_count ]]; then
        echo "‚úÖ All tasks ready for integration"
        return 0
    else
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è $((total_count - ready_count)) tasks still in progress"
        return 1
    fi
}
```

### Resource Contention Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è **GOTCHA**: Database/port conflicts during parallel testing
**Problem**: Multiple tasks trying to use same test database/ports
**Solution**: Resource allocation validation
```bash
# Validate resource allocation before starting
validate_resources() {
    local task_id="$1"
    
    # Check if allocated port is actually free
    if netstat -ln | grep ":$TASK_PORT "; then
        echo "‚ùå Port $TASK_PORT already in use"
        echo "Requesting new port allocation..."
        allocate_test_resources "$task_id"
    fi
    
    # Check if test database exists and is accessible
    psql "test_${task_id}" -c "SELECT 1;" 2>/dev/null || {
        echo "‚ùå Test database not accessible"
        echo "Recreating test database..."
        createdb "test_${task_id}"
    }
}
```

### Communication Overhead Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è **GOTCHA**: Over-communication vs under-communication
**Problem**: Subagents either spam Task Master or fail to communicate critical issues
**Solution**: Structured communication protocol
```bash
# Escalation decision tree
should_escalate() {
    local issue_type="$1"
    local impact="$2"
    
    case "$issue_type" in
        "merge_conflict")
            [[ "$impact" == "blocking" ]] && return 0 ;;
        "context_conflict") 
            return 0 ;;  # Always escalate context conflicts
        "resource_contention")
            [[ "$impact" == "blocking" ]] && return 0 ;;
        "integration_interface")
            return 0 ;;  # Always escalate interface changes
        *)
            return 1 ;;  # Don't escalate by default
    esac
    return 1
}

# Usage: should_escalate "merge_conflict" "blocking" && escalate_to_task_master
```
```

#### Implementation Blockers
```markdown
## Blocker Resolution with Context
### Technical Blockers:
1. **Context Review**: Check if similar problem solved in context
2. **Pattern Adaptation**: Adapt existing pattern to current need  
3. **External Research**: Use context sources for additional guidance
4. **Spike Task**: Create focused research task if needed

### Integration Blockers:
1. **Cross-Task Communication**: Coordinate with other subagents
2. **Context Alignment**: Ensure consistent pattern application
3. **Architecture Review**: Validate against architecture decisions
4. **Task Master Escalation**: Report integration conflicts
```

## Execution Monitoring & Coordination

### Real-Time Coordination
```bash
# Task Master monitoring script
monitor_tasks() {
    while true; do
        echo "=== Task Status Check $(date) ==="
        for task_dir in ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/*/; do
            task_name=$(basename "$task_dir")
            if [[ -f "$task_dir/status.txt" ]]; then
                status=$(cat "$task_dir/status.txt")
                echo "$task_name: $status"
            else
                echo "$task_name: Status unknown"
            fi
        done
        echo ""
        sleep 30
    done
}

# Subagent status reporting
report_status() {
    local status="$1"
    local message="$2"
    echo "$status: $message $(date)" > status.txt
    echo "Status updated: $status - $message"
}

# Usage in subagent:
# report_status "STARTED" "Context validated, beginning implementation"
# report_status "PROGRESS" "50% complete, patterns applied successfully"  
# report_status "COMPLETE" "All validation passed, ready for review"
# report_status "BLOCKED" "Missing dependency from task-02, waiting"
```

### Context Consistency Monitoring
```bash
# Validate context application across tasks
validate_context_consistency() {
    echo "Checking context consistency across all tasks..."
    
    for task_dir in ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/*/; do
        echo "Checking: $(basename "$task_dir")"
        
        # Check if context was accessed
        if [[ -f "$task_dir/.context_accessed" ]]; then
            echo "  ‚úÖ Context accessed"
        else
            echo "  ‚ö†Ô∏è Context not accessed"
        fi
        
        # Check if patterns were followed
        if grep -q "pattern_applied" "$task_dir"/*.ts 2>/dev/null; then
            echo "  ‚úÖ Patterns applied"
        else
            echo "  ‚ö†Ô∏è Pattern application not verified"
        fi
    done
}
```

### Handoff to Review Phase

## MANDATORY: Subtask Completion Results and Handoff

### Critical Completion Requirements

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: When subtask execution completes, the Task Master MUST provide explicit verification of all results before handoff. Future agents will start with ZERO context from this execution session.

#### 1. Complete File Results Verification Across All Worktrees (REQUIRED)
```bash
# MANDATORY: Verify results from all parallel subtask worktrees
echo "=== SUBTASK EXECUTION RESULTS VERIFICATION ==="
echo "All worktree results and file modifications:"

for worktree in ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/*/; do
    task_name=$(basename "$worktree")
    echo "\nüìã Worktree: $task_name"
    echo "Location: $worktree"
    
    if [[ -f "$worktree/TASK_COMPLETE" ]]; then
        echo "Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE"
        
        # Show files modified in this worktree
        cd "$worktree"
        echo "Files modified:"
        git status --porcelain | while read status file; do
            echo "  $status $file"
        done
        
        # Show feature branch created
        current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)
        echo "Feature branch: $current_branch"
        echo "Commits: $(git rev-list --count HEAD ^main 2>/dev/null || echo 'N/A')"
    else
        echo "Status: ‚ùå INCOMPLETE"
    fi
done

echo "\n=== FEATURE BRANCHES CREATED ==="
git branch -r | grep "feature/<feature>-" | sed 's/.*\///g'
```

#### 2. Comprehensive Results Summary for User (REQUIRED)
```markdown
## SUBTASK EXECUTION COMPLETION SUMMARY

### All Worktree Results
**Worktree Base**: ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/

#### Task 1: [Name]
- **Location**: `/absolute/path/to/worktree1/`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete / ‚ùå Incomplete
- **Files Modified**: [List key files with absolute paths]
- **Feature Branch**: `feature/<feature>-task1`
- **Key Deliverables**: [What was implemented]

#### Task 2: [Name] 
- **Location**: `/absolute/path/to/worktree2/`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete / ‚ùå Incomplete
- **Files Modified**: [List key files with absolute paths]
- **Feature Branch**: `feature/<feature>-task2`
- **Key Deliverables**: [What was implemented]

[Continue for all tasks...]

### Integration Points Verified
- **Cross-Task Dependencies**: [Status of how tasks integrate]
- **Shared File Coordination**: [How shared files were handled]
- **Interface Compatibility**: [How task interfaces connect]

### Verification Commands for User
**User can verify all results with these commands:**
```bash
# Check all worktrees and their status
for worktree in ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/*/; do
    echo "Checking: $worktree"
    cd "$worktree" && git status && git log --oneline -3
done

# Check all feature branches created
git branch -r | grep "feature/<feature>-"

# Verify specific worktree results
cd ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/task1/
ls -la  # See files in worktree
cat key-file.ext  # Check specific implementation

# Verify workplan committed to base branch
ls -la docs/workplans/<feature>/
```

### Current State Summary
**What exists now across all tasks:**
- ‚úÖ **Worktrees**: [Number] worktrees with completed implementations
- ‚úÖ **Feature Branches**: [Number] feature branches pushed to origin
- ‚úÖ **Workplan Archive**: Complete workplan with context preserved in docs/workplans/
- ‚úÖ **Integration Points**: [Status of cross-task integration]
- ‚è≥ **Next Required**: Integration review and branch merging

### Next Steps Required
1. **Immediate**: Review all feature branches for integration compatibility
2. **Integration**: Merge compatible branches and resolve conflicts
3. **Testing**: Run cross-task integration tests
4. **Final Review**: Overall feature functionality validation
5. **Cleanup**: Remove worktrees after successful integration

### For Future Agents
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Any future agent will need this context:
- **Feature Scope**: [Brief description of overall feature implemented]
- **Worktree Locations**: `~/work/worktrees/<feature>/` with [number] completed tasks
- **Feature Branches**: All branches prefixed with `feature/<feature>-`
- **Context Package**: Complete context preserved in `docs/workplans/<feature>/context/`
- **Integration Status**: [Current state of cross-task integration]
- **Outstanding Work**: [Any remaining integration or cleanup work]
```

#### 3. Branch Management State Documentation (REQUIRED)
```bash
# MANDATORY: Document complete branch state for handoff
echo "=== BRANCH MANAGEMENT STATE ==="
echo "Base branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
echo "Workplan committed: $(git log -1 --oneline --grep='workplan')"

echo "\nFeature branches created:"
for branch in $(git branch -r | grep "feature/<feature>-"); do
    branch_name=$(echo "$branch" | sed 's/.*\///g')
    echo "  $branch_name: $(git log -1 --oneline "$branch")"
done

echo "\n=== VERIFICATION COMMANDS ==="
echo "User can verify branch state with:"
echo "git branch -r | grep 'feature/<feature>-'"
echo "git log --oneline --graph --all | head -20"
echo "ls -la docs/workplans/<feature>/"

merge_worktree_to_branch() {
    local worktree_dir="$1"
    local task_name=$(basename "$worktree_dir")
    local feature_name="$2"
    
    cd "$worktree_dir"
    
    # Ensure all changes are committed
    if [[ -n $(git status --porcelain) ]]; then
        echo "‚ùå FATAL: Uncommitted changes in worktree"
        echo "Commit all changes before merging"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    # Create feature branch from worktree
    git checkout -b "feature/${feature_name}-${task_name}"
    
    # Push feature branch
    git push -u origin "feature/${feature_name}-${task_name}"
    
    echo "‚úÖ Worktree merged to branch: feature/${feature_name}-${task_name}"
}

# Execute for each completed worktree
for worktree in ~/work/worktrees/<feature>/*/; do
    if [[ -f "$worktree/TASK_COMPLETE" ]]; then
        merge_worktree_to_branch "$worktree" "<feature>"
    fi
done
```

#### 2. Commit Workplan to Base Branch (REQUIRED)
```bash
# MANDATORY: Workplan must be committed to base branch for future reference
commit_workplan_to_base() {
    local feature_name="$1"
    local base_branch="main"  # or "master" or your default branch
    
    # Switch to base branch
    git checkout "$base_branch"
    git pull origin "$base_branch"
    
    # Ensure workplan directory exists
    mkdir -p "docs/workplans"
    
    # Copy complete workplan with all context
    cp -r "requests/${feature_name}/" "docs/workplans/${feature_name}/"
    
    # Add completion metadata
    cat > "docs/workplans/${feature_name}/completion.md" << EOF
# Workplan Completion Report

## Feature: ${feature_name}
- **Completion Date**: $(date)
- **Tasks Completed**: $(find ~/work/worktrees/${feature_name} -name "TASK_COMPLETE" | wc -l)
- **Feature Branches Created**: $(git branch -r | grep "feature/${feature_name}-" | wc -l)

## Implementation Summary
- **Context Package**: docs/workplans/${feature_name}/context/
- **Task Files**: docs/workplans/${feature_name}/tasks/
- **Integration Report**: docs/workplans/${feature_name}/integration/

## Next Steps

2. Create pull requests for each feature branch
3. Merge to main branch after review
4. Clean up worktrees: rm -rf ~/work/worktrees/${feature_name}
EOF

    # Commit workplan to base branch
    git add "docs/workplans/${feature_name}/"
    git commit -m "Add workplan documentation for ${feature_name}

- Complete task breakdown and context package
- All worktrees merged to feature branches
- Ready for integration review and merge

Feature branches:
$(git branch -r | grep "feature/${feature_name}-" | sed 's/.*\///g' | sed 's/^/- /')"

    git push origin "$base_branch"
    
    echo "‚úÖ Workplan committed to base branch: $base_branch"
}
```

#### 3. Cleanup and Validation (REQUIRED)
```bash
# MANDATORY: Validate all worktrees are properly handled
validate_task_completion() {
    local feature_name="$1"
    local worktree_base="~/work/worktrees/${feature_name}"
    
    echo "=== Task Completion Validation ==="
    
    # Check all worktrees have been merged
    local unmerged_count=0
    for worktree in ${worktree_base}/*/; do
        task_name=$(basename "$worktree")
        if [[ -f "$worktree/TASK_COMPLETE" ]]; then
            # Check if feature branch exists
            if git branch -r | grep -q "feature/${feature_name}-${task_name}"; then
                echo "‚úÖ Task $task_name: Merged to feature branch"
            else
                echo "‚ùå Task $task_name: NOT merged to feature branch"
                unmerged_count=$((unmerged_count + 1))
            fi
        else
            echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Task $task_name: Not marked complete"
        fi
    done
    
    # Check workplan committed to base
    if [[ -d "docs/workplans/${feature_name}" ]]; then
        echo "‚úÖ Workplan committed to base branch"
    else
        echo "‚ùå Workplan NOT committed to base branch"
        unmerged_count=$((unmerged_count + 1))
    fi
    
    if [[ $unmerged_count -eq 0 ]]; then
        echo "‚úÖ ALL TASKS PROPERLY COMPLETED AND MERGED"
        echo "Safe to proceed with integration review"
    else
