# Task Planning Methodology

## Prerequisites Check

### MANDATORY: Before Planning Tasks
```markdown
## Previous Work Verification ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Previous Tasks Complete**: All prior tasks have been completed and marked as COMPLETE
- [ ] **Previous Subtasks Complete**: All prior subtasks have been completed and archived
- [ ] **Files Archived**: All previous task/subtask files have been moved to archive folders
- [ ] **Clean Slate**: No incomplete tasks or subtasks remain in active folders
- [ ] **Dependencies Resolved**: All blocking dependencies from previous work resolved

## Archive Verification
- [ ] **Archive Structure**: Previous work properly archived in `/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-task-name/`
- [ ] **Completion Documentation**: Previous tasks include completion reports and retrospectives
- [ ] **Knowledge Transfer**: Key learnings from previous work documented and accessible
- [ ] **Context Updates**: Any context updates from previous work incorporated

**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP**: Do not proceed with planning until ALL previous tasks/subtasks are complete and archived
```

## Quick Start Decision Tree

### Choose Your Approach:
- **üöÄ Simple Task** (< 2 hours, low risk) ‚Üí Skip to [tasks-execute.md](tasks-execute.md) 
- **‚ö° Medium Task** (2-8 hours, some complexity) ‚Üí Use Light Planning below + [tasks-execute.md](tasks-execute.md)
- **üéØ Complex Task** (> 8 hours, high risk/impact) ‚Üí Full methodology below
- **üîÑ Replacing Functionality** ‚Üí Mandatory: Full methodology + feature flags

### Light Planning (5-minute version):
```markdown
## Quick Plan Template
- **Risk Level**: Low/Medium/High
- **Files Affected**: [List 3-7 specific file paths]
- **Validation Command**: `[single command to verify success]`
- **Success Criteria**: [1-3 specific checkable outcomes]
- **Project Phase**: Prototype/MVP/Production
- **Feature Flag Needed**: Yes/No (Yes if replacing anything)
- **Context Sources**: [Key files/docs that informed approach]
- **Similar Patterns**: [Existing code that does similar things]
```

### Real Example:
```markdown
## Quick Plan: Add User Avatar Display
- **Risk Level**: Low
- **Files Affected**: src/components/UserProfile.tsx, src/types/User.ts, tests/UserProfile.test.tsx
- **Validation Command**: `npm test -- UserProfile`
- **Success Criteria**: Avatar shows when user has image, fallback shows when no image, tests pass
- **Project Phase**: Prototype
- **Feature Flag Needed**: No
- **Context Sources**: src/components/UserCard.tsx (existing avatar pattern), docs/design-system.md
- **Similar Patterns**: UserCard.tsx uses same image fallback logic, consistent with design system
```

**‚Üí Next Step**: Take this to [tasks-execute.md](tasks-execute.md) and start implementing

## Pre-Planning Analysis Phase (Full Methodology)

### 1. Comprehensive Request Analysis
```markdown
## Request Breakdown
- **Primary Objective**: [What is the main goal?]
- **Secondary Objectives**: [Supporting goals or side effects]
- **User Intent**: [Why does the user want this?]
- **Success Definition**: [How will we know it's complete?]
- **Scope Boundaries**: [What's explicitly in/out of scope?]

## Project Phase Assessment
- **Current Phase**: [Prototype/MVP/Beta/Production]
- **Data Strategy**: [Recreate vs Migrate test data]
- **Backwards Compatibility**: [Required/Nice-to-have/Not needed]
- **Production Readiness**: [Full/Minimal/Prototype-only]
- **User Base**: [Internal/Limited beta/Full production]

## Replacement Strategy (if replacing existing functionality)
- **Feature Flag Required**: YES (mandatory for all replacements)
- **Rollback Plan**: [How to switch back if issues arise]
- **Parallel Running**: [How long to run both versions]
- **Verification Criteria**: [What proves new version works]
- **Removal Timeline**: [When it's safe to remove old version]
```

### 2. Extensive Codebase Investigation & Context Capture

#### Required Context Sources (All must be documented):
```bash
# Codebase Context
find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.py" | head -20
grep -r "keyword" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" src/
git log --oneline -10  # Recent changes context
npm ls --depth=0       # Dependencies

# Project Documentation Context  
ls docs/ README.md CONTRIBUTING.md
grep -r "keyword" docs/
git log --oneline -- docs/ | head -5

# External Dependencies Context
npm info package-name  # For each major dependency
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo/releases/latest  # Latest versions
```

**Context Capture Requirements (Mandatory):**

- **Scale**: "How many users/requests/data volume are we expecting?"
- **Timeline**: "When do you need this completed?"
- **Preferences**: "Any specific libraries or patterns you prefer/avoid?"
- **Success Criteria**: "How will you test that this works correctly?"
- **Integration**: "What other systems need to work with this?"
```

## Risk Assessment & Derisking

### High-Risk Categories
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL RISKS** - Require approval before proceeding:

üîí **Security Risks**
- Authentication/authorization changes
- Input validation modifications  
- Credential handling
- Database access pattern changes
- External API integrations

üí• **Breaking Change Risks**
- Public API modifications
- Database schema changes
- Configuration format changes
- Dependency major version updates

‚ö° **Performance Risks**
- Database query modifications
- Large data processing
- Memory-intensive operations
- Network-heavy operations

üîß **Integration Risks**
- Third-party service dependencies
- Cross-service communication changes
- State management modifications
```

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
```markdown
## Risk Level: HIGH
**Strategy**: Minimal Viable Implementation + Mandatory Safety
- Create smallest possible proof-of-concept first
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **MANDATORY: Feature flags for any functionality replacement**
- Extensive test coverage (unit + integration)
- Rollback plan documented and tested
- Parallel operation period planned

## Risk Level: MEDIUM  
**Strategy**: Incremental Development
- Break into smaller, testable chunks
- Mock external dependencies
- Performance monitoring
- Backwards compatibility maintained
- Feature flags for user-facing changes

## Risk Level: LOW
**Strategy**: Standard Development
- Follow established patterns
- Basic test coverage
- Standard error handling
```

### Data Strategy Decision Framework
```markdown
## Prototype Phase: Recreate vs Migrate
**Choose RECREATE when**:
- Data volume is small (<1000 records)
- Schema changes are extensive
- Data relationships are simple
- Test data generation is automated
- Migration complexity > recreation time

**Choose MIGRATE when**:
- Data has complex business logic
- Historical data is valuable for testing
- Relationships are complex and hard to recreate
- Migration scripts needed for production anyway

## Production Phase: Always Migrate
- Comprehensive migration strategy required
- Zero-downtime approach planned
- Rollback procedures tested
- Data integrity validation automated
```

## Task Definition Framework

### File Scope Methodology
```markdown
## File Analysis
**Existing Files**: [List files that need modification]
**New Files**: [List files that need creation]
**Dependencies**: [Files that might be affected indirectly]
**Test Files**: [Corresponding test files needed]

## Scope Rules
- Max 3-7 files per task (for complexity management)
- Group logically related changes together
- Separate high-risk changes into isolated tasks
- Order tasks by dependency chain
```

### Task Sizing Guidelines
```markdown
## Task Size Philosophy
- **As small as practical**: Break down when it provides clear benefit
- **No artificial limits**: Some tasks naturally require more time/tokens
- **Atomic completion**: Each task should produce complete, testable functionality
- **Boundary respect**: Tasks should respect natural code boundaries

## Size Guidelines (Flexible)
- **Target Time**: 15-30 minutes per task
- **Acceptable Time**: Up to 60 minutes for complex, atomic units
- **Token Target**: Under 150k tokens per task
- **Token Acceptable**: Up to 300k tokens for unavoidable complexity
- **File Target**: 3-7 files per task
- **File Acceptable**: Up to 15 files if they form logical unit

## Task Sizing Assessment
```bash
# Estimate tokens per task component
estimate_task_tokens() {
    local task_files="$1"
    local context_size="$2"
    local implementation_complexity="$3"
    
    # Base token costs
    context_tokens=$((context_size * 1000))        # Context package size
    file_reading_tokens=$((task_files * 2000))     # ~2k tokens per file read
    implementation_tokens=$((implementation_complexity * 5000))  # 5k per complexity unit
    validation_tokens=10000                        # Testing and validation
    
    total_tokens=$((context_tokens + file_reading_tokens + implementation_tokens + validation_tokens))
    
    echo "Task Token Estimate: $total_tokens"
    
    if [[ $total_tokens -gt 150000 ]]; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è LARGE TASK: $total_tokens tokens > 150k target"
        if [[ $total_tokens -gt 300000 ]]; then
            echo "‚ùå TASK TOO LARGE: $total_tokens tokens > 300k limit"
            echo "MUST SPLIT: Reduce files or complexity"
            return 1
        fi
    fi
    
    echo "‚úÖ Task size acceptable: $total_tokens tokens"
    return 0
}
```

## Task Scope Boundaries & "Do Not Touch" Areas

### Scope Boundary Analysis (MANDATORY)
```markdown
## Impact Boundary Mapping
For each task, define clear boundaries to prevent unnecessary investigation:

### Direct Impact Zone (MODIFY)
- **Primary Files**: Files directly modified by this task
- **Direct Dependencies**: Files that import/use the modified files
- **Test Files**: Tests that directly test the modified functionality
- **Type Definitions**: Types directly related to the changes

### Secondary Impact Zone (REVIEW ONLY)
- **Indirect Dependencies**: Files that use direct dependencies
- **Integration Points**: Services that call modified APIs
- **Related Features**: Features that might be affected by changes
- **Documentation**: Docs that need updates

### No-Touch Zone (IGNORE)
- **Unrelated Services**: Services not using modified functionality
- **Legacy Code**: Old code not connected to changes
- **Future Features**: Planned but not implemented features
- **External Dependencies**: Third-party libraries and services
```

### Usage Analysis Commands
```bash
# MANDATORY: Analyze actual usage boundaries before task execution
analyze_component_usage() {
    local component_file="$1"
    local component_name=$(basename "$component_file" .tsx)
    
    echo "=== Usage Analysis for $component_name ==="
    
    # Find direct imports (MODIFY zone)
    echo "DIRECT IMPORTS (MODIFY zone):"
    grep -r "import.*$component_name" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | head -10
    
    # Find type usage (REVIEW zone)
    echo "TYPE USAGE (REVIEW zone):"
    grep -r ": ${component_name}Props" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | head -5
    
    # Find API calls (REVIEW zone)
    echo "API CALLS (REVIEW zone):"
    grep -r "api.*${component_name,,}" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | head -5
    
    # Count total usage
    local usage_count=$(grep -r "$component_name" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | wc -l)
    echo "TOTAL USAGE: $usage_count occurrences"
    
    if [[ $usage_count -lt 10 ]]; then
        echo "‚úÖ LIMITED SCOPE: Component has limited usage - safe for focused changes"
    elif [[ $usage_count -lt 50 ]]; then
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE SCOPE: Review listed files for impact"
    else
        echo "‚ùå BROAD SCOPE: Consider splitting task or extensive impact analysis"
    fi
}
```

üõë **PAUSE**: Get approval for high-risk items before implementation

## Handoff Complete
**Planning Phase Complete** ‚Üí **Next: [tasks-execute.md](tasks-execute.md)**

### FILES CREATED - VERIFICATION REQUIRED ‚úÖ
**User must verify these files exist before proceeding:**

1. **Planning Output File**: `todo.md`
   - **Location**: Current working directory
   - **Contains**: Complete task breakdown with context
   - **Verify with**: `ls -la todo.md && head -20 todo.md`

2. **Context Package** (if full methodology used):
   - **Location**: `requests/<feature-name>/context/`
   - **Files**: `codebase-analysis.md`, `external-sources.md`, `architecture-decisions.md`
   - **Verify with**: `ls -la requests/*/context/ && find requests/ -name "*.md" -type f`

3. **Ready-to-Execute Tasks File**:
   - **Location**: Same directory as planning file
   - **Contains**: Tasks formatted for execution phase
   - **Verify with**: `grep -c "Task:" todo.md` (should show number of tasks)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: The next agent (execution phase) will start with ZERO CONTEXT from this conversation. It will ONLY have access to:
- The files created above
- The current codebase state
- No memory of this planning discussion

**‚ö†Ô∏è STOP AND VERIFY**: User must confirm all files exist at specified locations before proceeding to execution phase.

**Next Step**: Only proceed to [tasks-execute.md](tasks-execute.md) after user confirms file creation.
