```

#### For MVP/BETA Phase
```markdown

- [ ] End-to-end user workflow tested
- [ ] Performance impact measured and acceptable
- [ ] Error scenarios handle real user edge cases
- [ ] Feature flags implemented (if replacing functionality)
- [ ] Rollback plan tested and documented
- [ ] Basic monitoring/alerting configured

## Integration Impact ✅
- [ ] Dependent systems/teams notified
- [ ] API changes backward compatible or properly versioned
- [ ] No breaking changes without migration plan
```

#### For PRODUCTION Phase
```markdown
## Full Production Validation ✅
- [ ] Security scan passed for all changes
- [ ] Performance tested under realistic load
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring/alerting configured
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures updated
- [ ] Oncall/support team trained on troubleshooting
- [ ] Business metrics defined and trackable
- [ ] Cross-team coordination completed
- [ ] Migration procedures tested (if applicable)

## Replacement Safety (if replacing existing functionality) ✅
- [ ] Feature flag implementation verified
- [ ] Both old and new versions running in parallel
- [ ] New version proven equivalent or better
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested successfully
- [ ] **NEVER REMOVE old version until new is fully verified**
```

### Critical Safety Rules

#### Data Strategy Validation
```markdown
## Prototype Phase Data Decisions ✅
- [ ] Test data recreation strategy documented and faster than migration
- [ ] Schema changes documented for future production migration
- [ ] Data loss acceptable for current phase confirmed
- [ ] Backup/restore procedures sufficient for prototype needs

## Production Phase Data Requirements ✅
- [ ] Migration scripts tested on production-like data
- [ ] Rollback data procedures verified
- [ ] Data integrity validation automated
- [ ] Zero-downtime migration strategy (if required)
```

#### Replacement Implementation Rules
```markdown
## MANDATORY: Feature Flag Implementation ✅
- [ ] Feature flag controls new vs old functionality
- [ ] Default state preserves existing behavior
- [ ] Flag can be toggled without deployment
- [ ] Monitoring tracks both versions' usage/performance

## MANDATORY: Parallel Operation Period ✅
- [ ] Both versions operational simultaneously
- [ ] Performance comparison data collected
- [ ] User feedback collected on new version
- [ ] Error rates compared between versions

## MANDATORY: Safe Removal Process ✅
- [ ] New version proven superior in ALL metrics
- [ ] Extended parallel operation period completed (minimum 1 week production)
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off on removal obtained
- [ ] Old code removal is separate, reviewable commit
- [ ] **RULE: Never remove old version in same commit as new version**
```
