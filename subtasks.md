## Master Request Workflow

### 1. Request Analysis & PRD Creation

#### Task Master Codebase Mapping Phase
**CRITICAL**: Before creating any tasks, the Task Master MUST:
1. **Deep Codebase Analysis**: Read relevant files, map change surface, identify integration points, document dependencies

2. **File Mapping Document**: Create `requests/<request-name>/file-mapping.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Codebase File Mapping
   
   ## Change Points Identified
   - Primary files requiring modification
   - Secondary files with dependencies
   - Test files that need updates
   - Configuration files affected
   
   ## File Dependency Graph
   - Shows relationships between files
   - Identifies circular dependencies
   - Maps data flow paths
   
   ## Integration Boundaries
   - API contracts between modules
   - Shared types and interfaces
   - External service touchpoints
   ```

3. **Task Decomposition**: 3-5 files per task, 15-30 min completion, logical grouping, testable outcomes

- Create master request folder: `requests/<request-name>/`
- Generate comprehensive PRD (Product Requirements Document) in `requests/<request-name>/prd.md`:
  ```markdown
  # Product Requirements Document
  
  ## Overview
  - Request summary
  - Business context
  - Success criteria
  
  ## Goals & Objectives
  - Primary goals
  - Secondary objectives
  - Non-goals (out of scope)
  
  ## High-Level Plan
  - Architecture overview
  - Component breakdown
  - Integration points
  
  ## Constraints
  - Technical constraints
  - Time constraints
  - Resource constraints
  - Dependencies
  
  ## Risk Assessment
  - Technical complexity, integration points, security vulnerabilities
  - Performance bottlenecks, breaking changes
  - Mitigation strategies
  
  ## Task Breakdown
  - Ordered task list by risk (high-risk first)
  - Risk level for each task (High/Medium/Low)
  - Dependencies between tasks
  - Estimated effort per task
  - Persona assignments
  - Mitigation strategies for high-risk items
  ```

### 2. Task Generation & Persona Assignment
Create individual task files in `requests/<request-name>/tasks/`:

### 3. Git Workflow Management

#### Git Setup:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/<request-name> && git push -u origin feature/<request-name>
git worktree add -b task/<task-id>-<description> ../worktrees/<task-id> feature/<request-name>
```

#### Execution Process:
1. Assign task to persona → Create worktree → Pre-test (dev tasks)
2. Execute with subagent → Track via git commits
3. Auto review/test cycle → Retry on failure (max 2x) → Integrate

#### Flow: 
Pre-Test → Dev → Review → Post-Test (with reset/retry on failure)

### 4. Task Master Responsibilities

The Task Master (orchestrator) will:

#### Phase 1: Deep Codebase Understanding
**Critical**: Task Master must understand codebase upfront:
1. **File Discovery**: Use Glob patterns, analyze structures, map relationships, document patterns

2. **Change Impact Analysis**: Identify modification files, map ripple effects, find dependencies

3. **Task Decomposition**: 3-5 file scopes, risk-ordered (high first), spike tasks for risky integrations, no file conflicts, logical grouping

#### Phase 2: Task Creation & Management
- Parse initial request and create PRD
- Generate file-mapping.md with complete codebase understanding
- Break down work into atomic, file-scoped tasks
- Assign appropriate personas
- Manage task dependencies
- Monitor progress via git
- Handle task failures and retries
- Coordinate integration

#### Principles:
1. **Deep Expert**: Task Master reads extensively, subagents get explicit scopes
2. **Small Tasks**: 15-30 min chunks, <10 files, with validation criteria

#### Review/Validation Rules:
- Review/Testing tasks may expand scope, document expansions, update file-mapping.md

#### Task Status Tracking:
```markdown
## Status Board
| Task ID | Title | Persona | Status | Attempt | Worktree | PR |
|---------|-------|---------|--------|---------|----------|-----|
| 01-research-api | API Research | Research Analyst | Completed | 1 | task/01-research-api | #12 |
| 02-design-schema | Schema Design | System Architect | Completed | 1 | task/02-design | #13 |
| 06-pre-test-auth | Pre-Test: Auth | Test Engineer | Completed | 1 | task/06-pre-test-auth | - |
| 03-dev-auth | Auth Implementation | Software Engineer | In Progress | 2 | task/03-dev-auth | - |
| 05-review-auth | Review: Auth | Senior Engineer | Pending | - | - | - |
| 06-post-test-auth | Post-Test: Auth | Test Engineer | Pending | - | - | - |

## Failure Tracking
| Task ID | Attempt | Failure Type | Feedback Summary |
|---------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| 03-dev-auth | 1 | Code Review | Missing error handling, incorrect types |

## Task Completion & Adjustment Expectations
- **Current State Required**: Every task must include current state assessment before starting
- **Success Criteria Tracking**: All success criteria must be checked off when completed
- **State Updates Required**: Update current state section to reflect reality after completion
- **End-of-Task Updates**: Every task completion must update remaining task list
- **Scope Adjustments**: Tasks may reveal partial completion, new requirements, or technical debt
- **Discovery Integration**: New findings become concrete tasks with proper prioritization
- **Spike Outcomes**: Research tasks generate actionable implementation tasks
- **Quality Improvements**: Technical debt and optimization opportunities become tracked tasks

## Task List Evolution Patterns:
```markdown
## Task Completion Review (Task 03-dev-auth - Attempt 2)

### Initial State:
- ❌ JWT service missing
- 🔄 Auth service has basic password validation
- ✅ User model ready

### Final State:
- ✅ JWT service implemented with full token generation
- ✅ Auth service enhanced with JWT integration  
- ✅ User model unchanged but properly integrated

### Success Criteria:
- [x] JWT service created with generateToken method
- [x] Auth service integrates JWT generation
- [x] Token includes user id, email, expiration
- [x] Tests cover token generation and validation

### Results:
- ✅ Completed: JWT token generation and validation
- 🔄 Partial: Error handling (implemented for auth, need for validation)  
- 🆕 Discovered: Need rate limiting for auth endpoints
- 🔧 Technical Debt: Legacy session cleanup in auth.service.ts
- 🧪 Spike Result: Redis integration feasible, need configuration task

## Updated Task List:
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware for auth endpoints  
  - **Current State**: No rate limiting exists, basic auth endpoints exposed
- [ ] Complete error handling for validation layer
  - **Current State**: Auth errors ✅, validation errors ❌, logging ❌  
- [ ] Clean up legacy session code in auth.service.ts
  - **Current State**: Legacy code identified, new JWT flow working
- [ ] Configure Redis connection and session store
  - **Current State**: Feasibility confirmed, connection config needed
- [ ] Update auth documentation with new JWT flow
  - **Current State**: Old docs exist, new flow implemented but undocumented
```
```

### 5. Integration & Completion

#### Integration:
```bash
git merge task/<task-id>-<description> && git worktree remove ../worktrees/<task-id>
```

#### Final Review:
- Consolidate all task outputs
- Update master PRD with outcomes
- Create integration test suite
- Prepare deployment artifacts

#### Archive Request:
```bash
# Move completed request to archive
mv requests/<request-name>/ archive/requests/$(date +%Y%m%d)-<request-name>/
git add archive/
git commit -m "Archive completed request: <request-name>"
```

### 6. Monitoring & Reporting

Generate progress reports in `requests/<request-name>/reports/`:
- Daily status updates
- Dependency tracking
- Risk assessments
- Blockers and mitigation

### 7. Example Usage

```bash
# Initialize a new master request
claude-code "Create a comprehensive authentication system with OAuth2, JWT tokens, and user management"

# This will:
# 1. Create requests/auth-system/ folder
# 2. Task Master performs deep codebase analysis (reads 50+ files)
# 3. Generate file-mapping.md with all touchpoints
# 4. Generate PRD with full requirements
# 5. Create 20+ small, file-scoped task files
# 6. Each task specifies exact files to read/modify/create
# 7. Each task includes validation commands
# 8. Set up git worktrees for parallel development
# 9. Assign personas and track progress
```
