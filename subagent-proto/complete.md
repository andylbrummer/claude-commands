### Archive Usage Warning for Future Task Masters
```
🔴 IMPORTANT FOR FUTURE TASK MASTERS:

This completed assumption-tested feature has been archived to: [archive-path]

For planning similar assumption-heavy features:
✅ Study the assumption identification approach in assumption-testing/critical-assumptions.md
✅ Review testing methodology in assumption-testing/testing-results-summary.md
✅ Learn from failed approaches in failed-approaches/lessons-from-failures.md
✅ Reference validated patterns in validated-patterns/
✅ Understand AI agent testing effectiveness in learnings/ai-agent-effectiveness-report.md
✅ Review ROI analysis in learnings/testing-roi-analysis.md

❌ DO NOT re-execute archived testing plans
❌ DO NOT assume testing results apply to different features
❌ DO NOT skip assumption testing based on archived examples
❌ DO NOT copy testing approaches without updating for current context

For new assumption-heavy features: Create fresh testing plans informed by archived methodology
```

### Archive Usage Warning for AI Agents
```
🔴 IMPORTANT FOR FUTURE AI AGENTS:

This archived assumption testing shows effective AI testing methodology:
✅ Study how critical assumptions were identified and prioritized
✅ Learn from parallel testing approaches for multiple alternatives
✅ Understand effective failure analysis and lesson extraction
✅ Review evidence documentation and decision-making frameworks
✅ Study pattern recognition from successful testing approaches

❌ DO NOT re-execute any archived testing plans
❌ DO NOT assume testing results apply to different contexts
❌ DO NOT copy testing approaches without validation for current feature
❌ DO NOT ignore lessons from failed testing approaches

For new assumption testing: Use archived methodology to inform new testing approaches
```

### Archive Usage Warning for Implementation Agents
```
🔴 IMPORTANT FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION AGENTS:

This archived feature shows production implementation based on assumption testing:
✅ Study how testing results guided implementation decisions
✅ Learn from validated patterns that were proven during testing
✅ Understand performance characteristics discovered through testing
✅ Review integration approaches that were validated
✅ Study error handling approaches that were tested

❌ DO NOT copy implementation without understanding testing context
❌ DO NOT assume implementation patterns apply to different features
❌ DO NOT ignore alternative approaches that were considered
❌ DO NOT skip validation that approaches still apply to current context

For new implementations: Use testing-validated patterns as reference for similar contexts
```
