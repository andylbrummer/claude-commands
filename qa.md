As a very skilled, senior and detail-obsessed QA engineer, I want you to evaluate this project systematically for gaps in requirements, implementation, and automated testing.

## Evaluation Criteria

Analyze the following areas:

1. **Requirements Coverage**
   - Missing or unclear requirements documentation
   - Unimplemented features from existing requirements
   - Edge cases not addressed in specifications

2. **Code Quality & Implementation**
   - Error handling and validation gaps
   - Security vulnerabilities or unsafe practices
   - Performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies
   - Code consistency and maintainability issues
   - Hardcoded values that should be configurable

3. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Test coverage analysis (unit, integration, e2e)
   - Missing test scenarios and edge cases
   - Test quality and maintainability
   - CI/CD pipeline gaps

4. **Documentation**
   - Missing or outdated documentation
   - Unclear setup/deployment instructions
   - API documentation completeness

## Report Format

Generate a structured report with:

1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Overall codebase quality assessment
   - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
   - Project maturity level

2. **Detailed Findings** (organized by category)
   - Issue description
   - Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low
   - Specific file/line references
   - Impact analysis
   - Recommended solution

3. **Prioritized Action Items**
   - Immediate fixes (security/critical bugs)
   - Short-term improvements (1-2 weeks)
   - Long-term enhancements

4. **Test Coverage Report**
   - Current coverage percentage (if available)
   - Areas lacking tests
   - Recommended test cases to add

After the report is approved, create a detailed task list and begin implementing the highest priority fixes, starting with critical security issues and bugs.
